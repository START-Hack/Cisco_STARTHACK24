## What is Cisco Spaces:

Turn Your Buildings into Smart SPACES, a cloud platform that connects people and  things with spaces with no additional hardware and drives efficiency and cost optimizations.

## Case Introduction:

Cisco SPACES offers location-based data of devices, things, people and can help to create several use cases. If you combine this data with business relevant data, there are unlimited possibilities. The current use cases are often related to guide people around. We need new ideas on what service to offer with the data we have. We also struggle with the integration of the data into applications or “user friendly” interfaces. To get an idea of the existing use-cases you can browse through the [Outcome Store](https://spaces.cisco.com/store/outcomes/).

Prototype of a use case to solve a need using the Cisco SPACES API’s and data from a business application. (i.e. find my colleague at Start Global, would use calculated coordinates of the client, lookup the registration data from the event and show me where my friend is). Moreover, participants are encouraged to explore the integration of AI/ML technologies to drive innovation and creativity in their proposed use cases.

The Target users of this solution are global companies and can include possibly every Cisco WLAN customer.

- End-users is its location-based services for them
- Real estate if it is floor heat maps
- IT/OT if it’s asset tracking

## Further Information:

At a high level, the data comes in from different network components (Cisco wireless LAN Controllers and Access Points, Catalyst switches, Webex devices, Meraki networks) and is fed into the Cisco SPACES cloud platform where it will be processed and consumed by different applications. For example, in case of Access Points, we can track the location end users that are connected to those Access Points. In addition, IoT data can also be leveraged coming from IoT Gateways residing on Cisco Access Points or Switches. Through APIs, this data can be accessed to develop innovative solutions, leveraging real-time information for various use-cases.

## Resources:

Cisco SPACES offers two primary APIs: REST APIs and the Firehose API, both documented in the [Cisco SPACES API Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/wireless/cisco-dna-spaces/partner-app/partner-firehose-api/Cisco_DNA_Spaces_API_Guide.pdf), [Cisco Spaces API Documentation](https://partners.dnaspaces.eu/docs/v1/basic/index.html#!c-dnas-partners-overview.html) and [Cisco DNA Spces Partner Firehose API Events Fora Standard Partners](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/cisco-dna-spaces/partner-app/partner-firehose-api/std.html#firehose_api_v1.EventsStreamRequest).

- **Firehose API**: This provides a continuous stream of real-time data from Cisco SPACES. It is advantageous for applications requiring up-to-the-minute information and a broader, continuous flow of data.
- **REST APIs**: In addition to the Firehose API, Cisco SPACES continues to also have some areas where REST APIs can be used. These APIs allow for specific, targeted data retrieval.

Participants are encouraged to explore the Firehose API for their use case as it offers more flexibility. To get an idea of how to use the Firehose API, participants can have a look at this [Code example](https://github.com/SimonLight001/DNASFirehose_MongoDB_Handler).

## Judging Criteria:
